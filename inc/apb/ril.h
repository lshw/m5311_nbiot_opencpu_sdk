 * This section introduces the Radio Interface Layer (RIL) interface APIs including terms and acronyms, supported features, software architecture, 
 * details on how to use this interface, RIL functions, enumerations and structures.
 * RIL is a middleware module that enables communication with Narrow Band Internet of Ting (NB-IoT) modem. In general, RIL is usullay  
 * responsible to manage and share CMUX channels to support multiple users to access modem simultaneously, construct AT 
 * command string by request, send command, receive command response, parse response string, report result codes and 
 * included subparameters to user, receive unsolicited result codes (URC) and broadcast to users waiting for the event.
 * RIL interfaces depend on the NB-IoT AT command set, each AT command almost has a corresponding RIL API to send. Please refer to 
 * MediaTek MT2625_NB-IoT AT Command Specification document for more information about each AT command.
